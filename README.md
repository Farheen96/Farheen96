- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Farheen
- Graduated with MSc in Data Science.
- ðŸ‘€ As a fresher in this field Iâ€™m interested in learning and implementing Data Science and its applications in the real world. Eventually, work as a Data Scientist.
- Whenever I work on an assignment or project. I start my analysis using the pipeline a.k.a the Data science life cycle :
- 1. Business understanding & problem framing: understanding the context of the customer and the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve with data.
- 2. Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: understanding the customers' data and its statistical properties as well as preparing a dataset for further analysis
  3. Feature engineering: using business context and expertise to create new data that may provide useful signals in the prediction of outcomes
  4. Modeling and evaluation: Using your engineered dataset to model an outcome and generate predictions. Then, testing these predictions against the ground truth to see whether they are reliable.
  5. Insights & Recommendations: turning the insights of this analysis into business decisions and recommendations.
